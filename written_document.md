Team name: Group4_YU Navigation Map

Basic concept:
             We decided to build an AR map on the York campus, and the projection will appear when you scan the building/sign on the campus. 
             That is a kind of AR navigation camera that leads the students to know what the path or the building is. 
             Using preselected targets (example the lassonde building sign), we will use text recognition in order to scan the sign, 
             then use that information to retrieve information about the building in question. For example, if we scan the Lassonde building sign, in AR, 
             a list of courses taught in the building and maybe a map of the building's internal layout will be produced in AR. 
             It would also give the user the option to save this information and use it as a guide inside the building so they donâ€™t get lost.
