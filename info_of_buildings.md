**Vari Hall**

Vari Hall is adorned with yellow brick and two lower rectangular structures extending from its sides, Vari Hall is a well-designed and extraordinary space. When I enter the building I am engulfed by a cylindrical-shaped hall and stories echoing of its outer walls. The building was constructed in 1992 and named after one of York University’s benefactors George Vari (1923-2010)—a Hungarian refugee from the revolution in 1956 who made a fortune in the construction industry—and his wife Helen.Of the three interconnected buildings, the Rotunda is most eye-catching; it has also been the centre of frequent social and political debates.

**Ross building**

The Ross Building was built with public money, opened in 1968, and named after a public figure, Murray Ross, York University’s first president. It is designed in a modernist-brutalist style, a rectangular concrete slab built to form the focus of the campus.The large area to the west of the Ross Building was confirmed as a centre point of the campus by promotional photos of the university in the 1970s, there are now replaced by various perspectives of Vari Hall.
